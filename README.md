           # Pyramid-program-

In these programs we make pyramid by using nested loop. Loop within the body of an other loop is called nested loop. Nesting can be done anywhere in the program
But it to be noted that increasing the nesting more complex the program.
In these programs:

1- In the first program we make pyramid 
   forwardly

2- In the second program we make pyramid reversly
